# R can do sums and divisions ...

12 / 7

# other operators -- subtraction, multiplication, and power of
#
# - * / ** ^ ( )

# 
# Excercises
#

# What does: 11 + 1 / 6  evaluate to ?

# Solution:
11+1/6

# Calculate 10 plus 2 all divided by 3 and then squared

# Solution:
((10+2)/3)^2



# Storing values
a <- 3              # assign the number 3 to OBJECT (variable) called "a"
b <- 5              # assign 5 to b

a                   # so what's the value of OBJECT "a"
b                   # ... and what's b

a + b               # we can add them together just like numbers

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
#
# What happens if we change a and then re-add a and b? [Hint: Try it now]

a = 2
a + b

# Does it work if you just change a in the script and then add a and b? [Hint: Try it]

a = 10
a + b

# Did you still get the same answer after you changed a? 
# If so, why do you think that might be?
# You need to store the variable in the script and run it

# We can also assign the result of a + b to a new variable, c. 
# How would you do this?


# Solution:
c = a + b 


# Logical operators
#
# == != < > >= <= !
# == means exactly equal to
# ! means not
# != means not equal to
# < means less than, > greater than; <= means less than or equal to, >= means greater than or equal to

weight_lb <- 55    # doesn't print anything

# Exercise
# 
# 
# What are the values after each statement in the following?

age  <- age - 20        # age is: 102
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index is: 0.93137525

# VH - we are overriding/ reassigning the values to the original variables -- mass and age
# How do we do we know if our answers are correct ? 
# [Hint: <highlight> [ALT][ENTER]

#
# Topic: Comments
#

# Comments (like this one) are usually helpful

     # they can also be indented

# They should be supportive (not redundant e.g. "this is a comment")

# 
# Exercise
# 
#
# Add explanatory comments to the following lines of code (VH: added comments below)
# VH: add comments to explain conversion

ft <- 3               #length in foot/ feet is 3
in <- ft * 12         #length in inches, convert from feet mutliply by 12
cms <- in * 2.54      #length in centimetres (cm), multiply inches by 2.54
m = cms / 100         #length in metres (m), multiply cm by 100

# Exercise
# --------
#
# Weâ€™ve seen that vectors can be of type character, 
# numeric (or double), integer, and logical. 
#
# But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
#
# eg:
#
#   thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)
#   thing
#   class(thing)
#
# What will happen in each of these examples?
#
  num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a") #class is character because of "a" 
  num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE) #class is numeric
  char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE) #class is character, true value is changed to character
  tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4") #class is character because of "4" --> written as a text
#
# [Hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects]
#
# Can you explain why you think it happens?

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
# How many values in combined_logical are "TRUE" (ie character 4 characters)
# in the following example:
#   
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)

# Topic: Subsetting vectors
# Presented by: Evan Matthews

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]             #if you want to get the second element, brackets is for elements
animals[c(3, 2)]       #if you want to get the third and second element, in order   

more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]   #this will produce a bigger list of animals, which includes elements of the previous
more_animals

# Conditional subsetting
weight_g <- c(21,   34,    39,   54,   55)
weight_g[   c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] #will select the elements that are TRUE

weight_g > 50     #will give a logical expression for each of the element in your object
weight_g[weight_g > 50]  #will give you elements that are bigger than 50

weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]  #the bar key is a pike that is equivalent to 'OR'; select elements <30 and >50

weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21] 

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat

# %in% tells you an element is part of a dataframe

animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat") #for all the animals, are all the animals are in this set
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")] #in this animal array, give me the subset animals

# Challenge
#
# Can you explain  why 
#
#  "four" > "five" 
#
# returns TRUE?
#
# Answer: because they are all characters and not integers/ numerical, comparison is based on alphabetical
