#---------------------
# Learning Objectives
#---------------------

# Describe the purpose of the dplyr and tidyr packages.
# Select certain columns in a data frame with the dplyr function select.
# Select certain rows in a data frame according to filtering conditions with the dplyr function filter .
# Link the output of one dplyr function to the input of another function with the ‘pipe’ operator %>%.
# Add new columns to a data frame that are functions of existing columns with mutate.
# Use the split-apply-combine concept for data analysis.
# Use summarize, group_by, and count to split a data frame into groups of observations, apply summary statistics for each group, and then combine the results.
# Describe the concept of a wide and a long table format and for which purpose those formats are useful.
# Describe what key-value pairs are.
# Reshape a data frame from long to wide format and back with the pivit_wider and pivit_longer commands from the tidyr package.
# Export a data frame to a .csv file.

#------------------
# Lets get started!
#------------------

install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
# dplyr and tidyr

# Load the dataset
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
View(surveys)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(surveys)


#-----------------------------------
# Selecting columns & filtering rows
#-----------------------------------
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)    #select these three columns

#showed some errors, so doing it differently

select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)        #select columns except these two columns

#Filter for a particular year

filter(surveys, year == 1995)                   #similar to select, but it's filtering and will show you all the 1995 data

surveys_1995 <- filter(surveys, year == 1995)

surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight<5)
surveys_snl <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_snl <- select(filter(surveys, weight <5), species_id, sex, weight) #this line does the same thing as lines 63 and 64



#-------
# Pipes
#-------

# The pipe is --> %>%
# Shortcut --> ctrl + shift + m or command + shift + m

# You don't have to keep typing your data frame anymore

surveys_snl <- surveys %>% 
  filter(weight < 5) %>% 
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

# This order can be less computationally intensive
surveys_snl2 <- surveys %>% 
  select(species_id, sex, weight)  %>% 
  filter(weight < 5)
  

#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# Using pipes, subset the ```surveys``` data to include animals collected before 1995 and 
# retain only the columns ```year```, ```sex```, and ```weight```.


surveys_sub <- surveys %>% 
  select(year, sex, weight) %>% 
  filter(year < 1995)  


surveys_sub <- surveys %>% 
  select(year, weight, sex) %>%   #ordering your columns does matter
  filter(year < 1995)  
  


#--------
# Mutate
#--------

surveys_weights <- surveys %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)

surveys %>% 
  filter(weight!="") %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/1000) %>% 
  head(20)
       
surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/1000) %>% 
  head(20)

#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# Create a new data frame from the ```surveys``` data that meets the following criteria: 
# contains only the ```species_id``` column and a new column called ```hindfoot_cm``` containing 
# the ```hindfoot_length``` values converted to centimeters. In this hindfoot_cm column, 
# there are no ```NA```s and all values are less than 3.

# Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

surveys_hindfoot <- surveys %>% 
  select(species_id, hindfoot_length) %>% 
  mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length * 0.1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_cm!=""), hindfoot_cm < 3)




#---------------------
# Split-apply-combine
#---------------------






#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# 1. How many animals were caught in each ```plot_type``` surveyed?

# 2. Use ```group_by()``` and ```summarize()``` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length 
#    for each species (using ```species_id```). Also add the number of observations 
#    (hint: see ```?n```).

# 3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? 
#    Return the columns ```year```, ```genus```, ```species_id```, and ```weight```.





#-----------
# Reshaping
#-----------







#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# 1. Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, 
#    and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, 
#    and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. 
#    It’s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.

# 2. Now take that data frame and pivot_longer() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.

# 3. The surveys data set has two measurement columns: hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each 
#    measurement per year in different plot types. Let’s walk through a common solution for this type of problem. 
#    First, use pivot_longer() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that 
#    takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight. 
#    Hint: You’ll need to specify which columns are being pivoted.

# 4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type. 
#    Then pivot_wider() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for pivot_wider().
